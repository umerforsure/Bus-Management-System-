# 🚌 **Bus Management System**  

The **Bus Management System** is a **Java-based application** designed to manage **bus routes, seat selection, and fare calculation** efficiently.  
It leverages **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**, including:  
- **Inheritance**  
- **Polymorphism**  
- **Interfaces**  
- **Exception Handling**  

This structured approach ensures **modular, maintainable, and error-resistant** functionality. 🚀  


## 🚀 Features  

- **🚌 Bus Creation and Management** – Add, update, and manage buses.  
- **🪑 Route-based Seat Selection** – Choose available seats for a journey.  
- **💰 Fare Calculation Based on Distance** – Automatically calculates fare based on the selected route.  
- **⚠️ Exception Handling for Invalid Inputs** – Prevents errors in booking and data entry.  
- **📦 Modular and Structured Code** – Easily extendable for future enhancements.  
- **✏️ Customizable Routes & Fares** – Modify routes, fares, and seat availability as needed.  

### 📍 Example Usage  

| Route (From → To)   | Fare (PKR) | Booked Seat No. |
|----------------------|------------|----------------|
| Islamabad → Lahore  | 1500       | 12             |
| Karachi → Multan    | 2000       | 5              |
| Peshawar → Quetta   | 2500       | 20             |

Users can modify these routes, fares, and seat availability in the code as required.
